# Visual Studio College Project
# This repository contains files for the visual basic "Tech 2 Go" order application project made for my Computing A-level.
# This program allows an employee to login, input items ordered by a customer, and transfers those orders to the drivers side of the system, where they can choose whether to accept an order delivery, and then complete the delivery and close the order when the job is done.
# This project was completed using the Visual Basic coding language on Visual Studio 2015
